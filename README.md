# Ruby on Rails Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create an exceedingly brief presentation of a ruby gem (~5 min). 


We encourage you to try to do a live demo / have a working code example. Please also [create a brief github gist](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/) (or "cheat sheet") for your fellow developers, outlining your findings, and linking to any helpful tutorials, resources, hints, and tips you discover in your research. 

This is a great project to use as a blog post and/or describe to potential employers.

You should aim to answer the following questions:

- What problem does the gem solve?
- How do you use it in a rails app?

## Topic/Gem Ideas
