# Ruby on Rails Lightning Talks

Your goal is to create an exceedingly brief presentation of a ruby gem (~5 min).


**Include a live demo or a working code example**. Please also [create a brief github gist](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/) (or "cheat sheet") for your fellow developers, outlining your findings, and linking to any helpful tutorials, resources, hints, and tips you discover in your research. 

This is a great project to use as a blog post and/or describe to potential employers.

You should aim to answer the following questions:

- What problem does the gem solve?
- How do you use it in a rails app?

## Topic/Gem Ideas

**Once you pick a gem, sign up in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gt_i5t22O_vnxHJTvejG_kqq434aaSTg8n5YUwq9kjA/edit?usp=sharing)**.

Here are a few gems you could research: 

* httparty
* rdoc
* nokogiri
* rqrcode
* Stripe
* better_errors for Rails
* awesome_print
* githug

Browse way more gems at  [Ruby Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) (outdated) or the newer [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/)!

Even more gems are listed [at an "awesome-ruby" repo](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby) and [semi-recent tutsplus article](http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/24-extremely-useful-ruby-gems-for-web-development--net-23863).


> You are welcome to suggest a gem not listed here!

## Examples

[This lightning talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) does a good job switching between slides and live-coding. We want you to live code! It's funny. You don't need to be funny!

[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4cryg-q_YM) is dense with good information! It's also funny - you don't need to be funny.

## Part II - Project-Based Talk

Now that you've had more experience investigating gems and technologies for a project, prepare another lightning talk!

You could talk about another gem like devise, a feature of Rails like mailers, or a front-end technology like SASS/SCSS. It should be something we haven't covered as a group.  

Try to tie your talk to something you worked on during your project - maybe:

- something you explored for the project, 
- something that solves a problem you encountered during the project,
- something you would want to incorporate into a future version of the project, 
- or something you're excited to use for a different project that feels more feasible after the last project.


**Once you pick your new topic, sign up a second time in [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-gFsFvXYKqLjJe28th0F98fgQJ3rZ3XwlXTlr7jquc/edit?usp=sharing)**. You should not have the same topic as someone else on your team.

Again, write a gist and prepare a demo if possible.  You should aim to answer the following questions:

- What about a previous project inspired you to investigate this topic?
- What problem does the tool you're describing solve?
- How do you use it in a rails app?
